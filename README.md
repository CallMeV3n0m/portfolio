#The Print-Perfect Interactive Resume & Dynamic Digital Portfolio
  This project is a foundational exercise in robust web development. It forces a deep understanding of responsive design beyond simple @media queries, pushing into the realm of print stylesheets for professional output. The "dynamic digital portfolio" aspect will introduce techniques for interactive content display using pure CSS, preparing students for more complex UI challenges.
